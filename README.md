This is the official repository for the modpack [Minecraft: Console Edition](https://modrinth.com/modpack/consoleedition)
Here you can report something in the issues, or get more information on the modpack itself!

All mods in Minecraft: Console Edition are *Open Source!* That means you can see the source code of every mod in the pack.

The official Download for Console Edition is available on Modrinth, as i am unable to redistribute it here.

# üêõ Issue Tracker

The issue tracker is open for the following things:

-  Accuracy Issues
-  Gameplay Bugs
-  Crashes
-  Performance Issues

# üõ†Ô∏è Mod Suggestions

In order to suggest a mod to the modpack, you should open an issue with the following information:

- State what the mod does
- State how the mod would fit into the modpack
